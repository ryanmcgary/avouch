x run initial migration:
  x recording
  x remoteurl
  x site 
  x users
x update models:
  x recording
  x remoteurl
  x site
  x users
x update controllers:
  x recording
  x remoteurl
  x site
  x lanyards
  x users
x create views:
  x recording
  x lanyards
  x remoteurl
  x site
x update routes 
	

x Get slider working
	x Import HTML from slider.html into full_lanyard
	x easy/quick solution: Create same or seperate embed.js, link different _full_lanyard(or if/else) with alt SCSS layout
	x Integrate Slider JS files into _embed.js
	x	reference parent div from JAVASCRIPT tag. To prevent having to reference tagID when hiding.

	x Add Formatting CSS to blog-embed.scss
	x Make sure embed-clear.scss clears slider correctly
	x Create remoteurl/show that works correctly with banner version
	x single link to login use ?key=value string to /closewindow to invoke login through chosen provider
	x unified clear file
	x width for slider currently requires var widget_width & div manual width to be set. fix this.
	x finish slider, add markup to pull from DB
		x Make sure new remoteurl doesn't break banner version, also redirect of iframe needs to link to correct url
	

x make remoteurl/show to only show login links/popups if not loggedin
	x Mostly there. Add support for blog style and make multiple buttons
		x seperate layout for blog vs banner login buttons
		x finish PSD

		x Avouch identifier/link in top right


x create devise layout / css
	x edit settings form
	x new user form
x namespace:admin just start with site
	x admin/sites#index = moderation > @current_user.sites.recordings each do
		x list site
		x show recording
		x SORT by site
		x publish/unpublish
		
	x admin/site/thelma/install = install

x option 2: ! GOT THIS WORKING, mostly
	x get errors to work without resorting to render_with_scope

	x admin/user/edit = administration
		x in view also have form linking
	
	x get banner/blog embed working
		x banner
		x blog
		x	just need top/bottom to work
	x figure out where to link install to
		
x create dashboard
	x create install page / install
		x copy css
		x copy html
		x get banner/blog working
	x moderation
		x view all recordings by site/remoteurl
		x publish/unpublish recordings
		x create virtual remoteurls (tag based)
		x list sites
	x admin
		x update profile

x double check validations
x double check login permissions (add them to admin)
x make sure code created at install page is correct
	x top/bottom not doing anything
	x now using simplified embed
	x jquery code... eh
x Make sure you can't delete user acounts
x view for moderation if no recordings/sites
x Make sure that uniqueness (sitename,user,etc.)is set on DB
x admin/site/new
x weird error where failed site is show until refresh?
x Direct login links not redirecting after sign_in correctly (broken if not already logged in, works if you are already logged into socialauth provider)
x add delete site?

! create homepage

! share and like links should work

javascript include tag audio/js?

https?

- find alternative dashboard design?

	
Give user direct recordings
	- still have free account be tied to a site
	- add for_user column to recordings model/table	
		- will that break thing currently displaying for sites? prob not
	- add claimable recordings via E-mail
	- add user recordings embed
	- what would view look like?
Add direct call
	- click on user to initiate call
	- payment/credit system?
		- model: credits belongs to users add/spend
		- model: call user controller/views






? it would be better if creation of remoteurl occurs in controller/embed before JS is called or on submit, or on creation of new recording?
? Do I want to add notices to admin area?
- For Moderation: create virtual remoteurls (adding tag based system)
? auto iterate site name cnn.com created a second time would yield cnn.com2
? Add additional / authentications in edit "settings"


? Jquery loading
	- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5187451/how-to-determine-if-jquery-is-running-on-a-page-even-if-jquery-is-after-the-d
? upgrade account

? can I do routes based on embed type as a get: member or should I stick with a partial?

Launch! (keep caching issues in mind)
or 
Revamp these:
	- lanyard_controller/embed checks for nil remoteurl, serves content accordingly
	- remoteurl/show no longer creates DB on show
		- on creation of review check for remoteurl and creates it
	- load css into head using _embed.js instead of rendering _everything_css from _lanyard

Maybe's & Possible required fixes
? TODO: Use session helper on remoteurl/show to redirect back to originating url including variables 
	- I think just adding <% session.delete(:return_to) %> to the create account form should be enough. Currently this is a rare issue.
? make new site error form behave like user/edit form
? will need to add devise "soft delete"
? replacing Jquery OR compatibility mode / Would need:
	- resize class/id's
	- get script
	- popup window OR modal window
	- toggle visibility (maybe)
	- slider
? Shared html structure
? <%= render :partial => "link_area", :layout => "graybar" %>?



Investigate crossdomain goodies
Avouch 2.0
	- Use javascript to let user add iteration number to each embed
	! go ahead and allow people to review/call users on this system
	! Users given their own free profile page
	! after first phone call change recording system to allow review from computer
	! ? multi part/question review script instead of freeform text box
		? RAILSCAST private-pub for question by question audion form
	
	? make larger buttons for wide embeds

SCRATCH PAD
--------------------
? Way to encrypt phone numbers?
? Validation: Strip phone number
? create drop down menu from "powered by iAvouch"
? redirect to specific page after login: https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki/How-To:-Redirect-to-a-specific-page-on-successful-sign-in
? auto generate password: https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki/How-To:-Automatically-generate-password-for-users-(simpler-registration)
? direct auto login url: http://zyphmartin.com/blog/simple-auth-token-example-with-devise

multi version / embed iteration
embed-banner.js
if multi-version-n = 1
	if var multi-version-iteration defined set at 1
		cancel
	else
		$('div[id="test"]').not(':eq(0)').each(function(i){
		    var $that = $(this),
		        newID = $that.attr('id') + (i + 1)

		    $that.attr('id', newID).text(newID)
		})
		change above to check for banner & blog and render on each instance
		insert css w/ id changed dynamically directly from embed.js
		set var multi-version-iteration at 1
if var = banner
	render partial: lanyard-banner
if var = blog
	render partial: lanyard-blog
