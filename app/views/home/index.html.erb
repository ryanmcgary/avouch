iAvouch the reference redefined


Listen to this: Real people only, no robots allowed.
Trust. Confirmed: We handle reference confirmation.
Portable Embed: Show your references anywhere.
Totally yours: Stop suffering from LinkedIN "lock in". 



This isn't a walled off "social service" that will send you a million e-mails just to extract all the value from your business relationships, these references retain value even if you export them from our system, we give you total freedom.

Zero Risk. But what do you gain?

A/B testing demonstrates: 
	A 50% increase in conversion (even from sites that have already been heavily optimized).
	2x increase in pageviews and time spent on site (More time spent exploring your site means less time trying to find competitors).
	Stand out from competitors for your service (or for the job you are trying to land, I mean do you really think your paper references help you stand out? By the time paper references are checked by HR they hardly even matter).
